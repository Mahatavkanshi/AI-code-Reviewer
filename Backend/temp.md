**Issues:**

* **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum` is declared without any input parameters (`a` and `b` are not defined
within the function's scope).
* **Scope Error:** Since `a` and `b` are not defined within the function, the code will likely result in an error when
executed (ReferenceError).

**Recommended Fix:**

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Improvements:**

* **Parameters Added:** The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the numbers to be summed.
* **Correct Scope:** The variables `a` and `b` are now properly defined within the function's scope, resolving the
error.

**Explanation:**

The original code snippet tries to access variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function `sum`. In
JavaScript, variables must be either declared locally within a function or accessible in a higher scope (e.g., global
scope). By adding `a` and `b` as parameters to the function definition, we ensure that the function knows where to get
these values when it's called.
